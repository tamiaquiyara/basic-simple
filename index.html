                <h4>City of Miami</h4>
                <p>Miami is a coastal metropolis located in southeastern Florida,United States. I have always wanted to
                    go to Miami because of how vibrant the city is, and the different people in it. The different
                    cultures all together. The nightlife of Miami also intrigued me, so full of colours and activity.
                    Miami has always been a place I want to visit since I’ve seen it on TV. There are so many
                    opportunities there and that’s exciting. It’s on the coast so they’ve also got a great beach too.</p>

                like no other. I’ve started to learn it but I haven’t made more time to practice it.</p>

                <h4>Iziko Slave Lodge</h4>

                <p>The Slave Lodge is one of the oldest buildings in Cape Town. The building has answered to many
                        names in the last three centuries, namely; Slave Lodge, Government Offices Building, Old Supreme
                        Court, and SA Cultural History Museum. </p>
                <p>In 1998 this museum was renamed the Slave Lodge. Under the umbrella theme, ‘From human wrongs to
                        human rights”. Exhibitions on the lower level of this museum explore the long history of slavery
                        in South Africa.</p>
                <p>The Slave Lodge was built in 1679, making it the second oldest existing colonial structure of the
                        Cape Colony, today known as Cape Town. </p></div>

                <h4>Parliament of South Africa</h4>

                <p>The Houses of Parliament of South Africa are situated in Cape Town. The building consists of
                        three main sections: the original building, completed in 1884, and additions constructed in the
                        1920s and 1980s.</p>
                <p>Queen Victoria granted permission for the establishment of a parliament in the Cape Colony in
                        1853.</p>
                <p>In the 1920s, Parliament commissioned Sir Herbert Baker to build an extension to the building,
                        including a new chamber for the House of Assembly. The old Assembly chamber became the
                        Parliamentary Dining Room. A further extension was created in the 1980s.</p></div>
